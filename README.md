# Snap collector plugin - VMWare vSphere

This plugin collects performance counters data for VMWare vSphere cluster, using [govmomi](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi) - library communicating with  [vCenter server](http://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html).

## Getting Started

In order to use this plugin you need cretendials (URL, username, password) to vCenter server - VM in vSphere cluster used for managing and retrieving metrics from entire cluster.
Plugin is designed for vSphere clusters with *performance counter* feature (from version `2.5`).

### System Requirements

* [Snap](http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap)
* [golang 1.6+](https://golang.org/dl/) (for building)
* [snap-plugin-utilities](http://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-utilities) (for building)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by Snap:
* Linux/amd64
* Darwin/amd64

### Installation

#### To build the plugin binary:
Get the source by running a `go get` to fetch the code:
```
$ go get -d github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-vsphere
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-vsphere && make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/`.


### Configuration and Usage

* Set up the [Snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started).

* Add vSphere plugin configuration information to the Task Manifest ([example](./examples/file.yaml))

* Load the plugin and create the task

## Documentation 

### Collected Metrics
This plugin has the ability to gather memory, CPU and network metrics for each host, and detailed IO metrics for each VM-mounted virtual disk from your vSphere infractructure.

**vSphere Metric Catalog**

See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md)

**Counter interval**

vCenter and ESXi servers collect data for each performance counter every 20 seconds and maintain this data for an hour. So, recommended interval is the multiple of 20 seconds to prevent ineffective API calls.
For more details, see VMWare vSphere documentation - [Retrieving performance data](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.wssdk.pg.doc%2FPG_Performance.19.4.html) and [Performance intervals](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.wssdk.pg.doc/PG_Performance.19.6.html) .


### Examples
Example retrieving memory metrics from hosts in snap-plugin-collector-vsphere and writing data to a file. Assuming you have snap-plugin-collector-vsphere and [snap-publisher-file](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-publisher-file) binaries.  
 
Ensure [Snap daemon is running](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#running-snap):
```
$ snapteld -l 1 -t 0 &
```

Load Snap plugins:
```
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-collector-vsphere
$ snaptel plugin load snap-plugin-publisher-file
```

See available metrics for your system:
```
$ snaptel metric list --verbose

Add URL, username, password, and vSphere cluster name to task configuration, you can use an example:
```
$ cat examples/task/file.yaml 
---
  version: 1
  schedule:
    type: "simple"
    interval: "20s"
  max-failures: 10
  workflow:
    collect:
      metrics:
        /intel/vmware/vsphere/host/*/mem/*/free: {}
        /intel/vmware/vsphere/host/*/cpu/*/idle: {}
        /intel/vmware/vsphere/host/*/vm/*/virtualDisk/*/readIops: {}
      config:
          "/intel/vmware/vsphere":
            "url": "https://localhost/sdk"
            "username": "admin@domain"
            "password": "pass"
            "insecure": true
            "clusterName": "cluster"
            "datacenterName": "DC"
      publish:
        - plugin_name: "file"
          config:
            file: "/tmp/memory.log"
```


Provide correct credentials to vCenter endpoint and create a task
```
$ snaptel task create -t examples/task/file.yaml
Using task manifest to create task
Task created
ID: 37cd9903-daf6-4e53-b15d-b9082666a830
Name: Task-37cd9903-daf6-4e53-b15d-b9082666a830
State: Running
```

See the file output (part of the output):
```
$ tail -f /tmp/memory.log
```

Or watch task values:
```
$ snaptel task watch 37cd9903-daf6-4e53-b15d-b9082666a830
```

### Roadmap
This plugin is still in active development and its metric catalog has to be extended. Items that must be covered as first are:
- [ ] Add SWAP metrics (figure out how to calculate full SWAP space)
